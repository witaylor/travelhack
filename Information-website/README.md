This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Things to Include
A list of ideas that we should either chat about or add to the website, etc.
* A quick start guide containing things like setting up a GitHub repo and adding collaborators etc
* Git cheat sheet page on the website
* link to Kaggle for data sets

# Scenario Ideas
Put all your ideas for traveller problems/scenarios here plz

For the hackathon, we should convert these ideas to the problems rather than the solutions. So instead of giving ideas/examples of apps, give candidates problems to solve. 
E.g. for the POI Route Finder, could say something like "As a traveller looking to explore popular landmarks in London, I want to do so using the shortest (or cheapest) route."

**Questions**
* Would we score groups higher if they think of their own/unique problem to solve?
  * I don't think we should bc otherwise it may encourage groups to spend too much time planning their problem as they might feel pressured to think of a unique issue. Curious to see what you guys think though. [Will]

## POI Route Finder 
An app that can find the shortest (or cheapest) route betwen a list of set POIs

The user could;
* input a list of POIs, or select all in an area 
* choose sort, e.g. cheapest, shortest distance 


## Interrail Planner
An app that helps you book trains to maximise the amount of time you get to spend in each country.

Possible features:
* Input list of countries to visit and get back best route to visit all those countries
* Filter results by price or maximised time
* Input 2 countries and display all possible routes between them 
* Most popular routes by previous interrailers
* Blog for the user to keep track of photos and memories during the trip
